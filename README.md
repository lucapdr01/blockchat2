# blockchat2

In this project I built a social network website where users can register and post their thoughts.
I used HTML,CSS and Bootstrap in the Front-end, for the Back-end I used Django and all the information are stored in an SQL db
but each post is associated with a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain to prove it's existance(Web3.py to interact with Etherum).
To make the feed loading faster I implemented a chaching system with Redis.
